This website was made to test out and learn both React and Styled components.
Main purpose of this site was to make it print friendly, something that I did not put enough effort into, as it does not print well on paper.

It does however do a decent job as a simple web-hosted cv.

## technologies

- react
- styled-components
- netlify
