This page further evolved into something much more interesting. Keeping time, making plans, integrating to google docs as a backend for the punishment system, and a lot of other things.

The most exciting thing however is the [unrated](https://glassburet.no/unrated) page. We got together every friday, listened to an album from start to finish and rated it.
It was a fun break from all the other things going on every day. It was also a good excuse to drink a good beer with friends without going all out.
